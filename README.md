# This is my portfolio

This repository is dedicated to projects I have participated in

[**Honours thesis on prediction of chaotic signals**](https://github.com/justsvykas/Is-Chaos-Good-For-Reservoir-Computing-): In this thesis I experimented with math of RNN architectures in order to improve them when predicting chaotic signals

[**Project BeepTweet**](https://github.com/justsvykas/BeepTweet): This respisotory is based on a final project in Hands-on AI course in University of Hong Kong where our team created an AI program BeepTweet which detects emotion from tweets and generates music based on emotion.

**Churn Prediction Model**: While working in Whatagraph I created a churn prediction model to aid Customer Success team to indicate customers which might churn next month.

[**Ambulance location model**](https://github.com/justsvykas/ambulance_location_model/tree/main): This project was submitted for Modelling course in University of Aberdeen. Our team has used Google API and Wolfram API to determine the best location for extra ambulance station in Aberdeen.
