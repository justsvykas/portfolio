# This is my portfolio

This repository is dedicated to projects I have participated in

[**Honours thesis on prediction of chaotic signals**](https://github.com/justsvykas/Is-Chaos-Good-For-Reservoir-Computing-): In this thesis I experimented with math of RNN architectures in order to improve them when predicting chaotic signals

[**Project BeepTweet**](https://github.com/justsvykas/BeepTweet): This respisotory is based on a final project in Hands-on AI course in University of Hong Kong where our team created an AI program BeepTweet which detects emotion from tweets and generates music based on emotion.
